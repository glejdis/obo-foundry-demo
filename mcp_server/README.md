# Aldi Store Ops — MCP Server (Flow B)

A remote **MCP server** (streamable-HTTP) exposing the Aldi Filial-Assistent
tools. The personalized tools use the **OBO / OAuth identity passthrough** flow:
the server reads the caller's user token from the `Authorization` header and
calls Microsoft Graph **as the signed-in employee**.

## Tools

| Tool | Type | Identity |
|------|------|----------|
| `get_store_hours(day)` | generic | none |
| `find_product(product_name)` | generic | none |
| `get_my_employee_info()` | **OBO** | Graph `/me` as the user |
| `get_my_shifts()` | **OBO** | identity via `/me`, then the user's roster |

## Run locally

Terminal 1 — start the server:
```
python mcp_server/server.py
```
Serves streamable-HTTP at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`.

Terminal 2 — test client (signs you in, passes the token as Foundry would):
```
python mcp_server/local_client.py
```

The client injects `Authorization: Bearer <user-token>` — the same mechanism
Foundry uses when OAuth identity passthrough is configured.

Terminal 2 (alternative) — a **Microsoft Agent Framework** agent that consumes
this server via `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` (from the repo root):
```
python filial_agent_mcp.py "Welche Schichten habe ich?"
```
It signs the user in and attaches the token as an `Authorization` header, so the
server runs the OBO exchange as that employee. Set `MCP_SERVER_URL` to target the
deployed server instead of the local default (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`).

## Deploy to Azure Container Apps

From the repo root:
```
./mcp_server/deploy.ps1
```
This builds the image in the cloud (ACR Tasks — no local Docker push), creates
the Container Apps environment, exposes public HTTPS on port 8000, and stores
`CLIENT_SECRET` as a Container Apps secret. It prints the public endpoint:
```
https://<app>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io/mcp
```
Defaults: resource group `rg-Foundry`, region `swedencentral`, app
`aldi-store-ops-mcp`. Override via `-ResourceGroup` / `-Location` / `-AppName`.

The public endpoint validates that each caller's token audience matches the
`obo-demo` app (`MCP_VERIFY_SIGNATURE=true`) before running any OBO exchange.

## Use it from the MAF agent

Once deployed, point `filial_agent_mcp.py` at the public URL and run it:
```
$env:MCP_SERVER_URL = "https://<app>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io/mcp"
python filial_agent_mcp.py "Welche Schichten habe ich?"
```
The agent signs the user in and passes the token as an `Authorization` header, so
the server runs the OBO exchange as that employee.
